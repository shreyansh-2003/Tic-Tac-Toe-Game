# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game  

## Description
GUI based Tic-Tac-Toe game, made for playing multiplayer or against the computer. The game is an application project for OOPs and data structures concepts. It makes use of Tkinter and TKmacosX module in particular for the UI design.
The playing against the computer has been ```removed``` due to bug issues (uncontrolable accuracy). A reinforcemnent learning package can be used to train the model, to make the right moves.
